[200~# 0x02 Python - Import Modules

This repository contains exercises and examples related to the topic of importing modules in Python. In Python, modules are files that contain Python code, which can include functions, classes, and variables. Importing modules allows you to use code from other files in your current script, making your code more organized, modular, and reusable.

## Files

Each subdirectory within this repository contains its own set of Python scripts and exercises related to a specific aspect of importing modules. Here's a brief overview of the subdirectories and their contents:

- [0-add.py](./0-add.py): Example script demonstrating how to import a function from another module and use it in your code.
- [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py): Another example demonstrating the use of functions imported from a different module.
- [2-args.py](./2-args.py): Exploring command-line arguments and how to access them in your Python script.
- [3-infinite_add.py](./3-infinite_add.py): Using the sys module to work with command-line arguments and perform addition.
- [4-hidden_discovery.py](./4-hidden_discovery.py): Showing how to access hidden names (those starting with an underscore) within a module.
- [5-variable_load.py](./5-variable_load.py): Importing a variable from a module and using it in your script.

Feel free to explore each file to learn more about the concepts of importing modules and working with Python code from different files.
