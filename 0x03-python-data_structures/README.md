# 0x03. Python - Data Structures

This directory contains exercises and tasks related to Python data structures. In this module, you will learn about various data structures in Python, such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, along with their properties and manipulation techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the concepts of data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- Perform operations and manipulations on different data structures.
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable data structures.
- Apply your knowledge to solve problems and tasks using Python data structures.
