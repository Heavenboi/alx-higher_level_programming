# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

Welcome to the "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" directory of my second semester repository for ALX High-Level Programming.

In this semester, I will be diving into Python programming and exploring the fundamentals of control structures, loops, and functions. Python is a versatile and powerful language that enables me to create efficient and dynamic programs. This directory will document my progress as I learn and apply these essential concepts.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the concepts of conditional statements (if/else) and how they control the flow of a program.
- Master the usage of loops, including `while` and `for` loops, to iterate and perform tasks efficiently.
- Explore the world of functions and learn how to create modular and reusable code.
- Apply my knowledge to solve real-world programming challenges using Python.

## Directory Structure

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A simple Python script to demonstrate conditional statements by checking if a random number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: A script that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and evaluates its relation to 5.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A script that prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using a loop.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A similar script as above, but this time using conditional statements to exclude the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A script that prints pairs of two-digit numbers, with each pair separated by a comma and a space.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, without repetition.
- `7-islower.py`: A function that checks if a given character is a lowercase letter.
- `8-uppercase.py`: A function that converts a string to uppercase, excluding the first character.
- `9-print_last_digit.py`: A function that prints the last digit of a number and returns its value.
- `10-add.py`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-pow.py`: A function that calculates the power of a number.
- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 and 5 with "Fizz" and "Buzz," respectively.
- `13-insert_number.c`: A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

## Getting Started

To run the Python scripts in this directory, you can use the command:

```sh
python script_name.py
